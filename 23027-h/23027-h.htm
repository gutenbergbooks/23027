<h3>THE ROLLIAD.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(22d Ed., 1812.)</p>

  <p>Finding that my copy of <i>The Rolliad</i> ("<span class="sc">Notes
  and Queries</span>," Vol. ii., p. 373.) contains fuller information
  regarding the authors than has yet appeared in your valuable periodical,
  I forward you a transcript of the MS. notes, most of which are certified
  by the initial of Dr Lawrence, from whose copy all of them were taken by
  the individual who gave me the volume.</p>

<h3>NOTE ON PALAMON AND ARCITE.</h3>

  <p>It has probably often been remarked as somewhat curious, that Chaucer,
  in describing the arrival of Palamon and Arcite at Athens, mentions the
  day of the week on which it takes place:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And in this wise, these lordes all and some,</p>
      <p>Ben on the Sonday to the citee come," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Nothing seems to depend on their coming on one day of the week rather
  than on another. In reality, however, this apparently insignificant
  circumstance is astrologically connected with the issue of the contest.
  Palamon, who on the morning of the following day makes his prayer to
  Venus, succeeds at last in winning Emelie, though Arcite, who commends
  himself to Mars, conquers him in the tournament. The prayers of both are
  granted, because both address themselves to their tutelary deities at
  hours over which these deities respectively preside. In order to
  understand this, we must call to mind the astrological explanation <!--
  Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>{132}</span>of
  the names of the days of the week. According to Dio Cassius, the
  Egyptians divided the day into twenty-four hours, and supposed each of
  them to be in an especial manner influenced by some one of the planets.
  The first hour of the day had the prerogative of giving its name, or
  rather that of the planet to which it was subject, to the whole day.
  Thus, for instance, Saturn presides over the first hour of the day, which
  is called by his name; Jupiter over the second, and so on; the Moon, as
  the lowest of the planets, presiding over the seventh. Again, the eighth
  is subject to Saturn, and the same cycle recommences at the fifteenth and
  at the twenty-second hours. The twenty-third hour is therefore subject to
  Jupiter, and the twenty-fourth to Mars. Consequently, the first hour of
  the following day is subject to the sun, and the day itself is
  accordingly dies Solis, or Sunday. Precisely in the same way it follows
  that the next day will be dies Lunæ; and so on throughout the week. To
  this explanation it has been objected that the names of the days are more
  ancient than the division of the day into twenty-four parts; and Joseph
  Scaliger has attempted to derive the names of the days from those of the
  planets, without reference to this method of division. His explanation,
  however, which is altogether geometrical, inasmuch as it depends on the
  properties of the heptagon, seems quite unsatisfactory, though Selden
  appears to have been inclined to adopt it. At any rate, the account of
  the matter given by Dio Cassius has generally been accepted.</p>

  <p>To return to Chaucer: Theseus, as we know, had erected in the place
  where the tournament was to be held three oratories, dedicated to Mars,
  to Venus, and to Diana. On the day after their arrival, namely, on
  Monday, Palamon and Arcite offered their prayers to Venus and Mars
  respectively, and Emelie, in like manner, to Diana. Of Palamon we are
  told that&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"He rose, to wenden on his pilgrimage</p>
      <p>Unto the blisful Citherea benigne"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>two hours before it was day, and that he repaired to her temple "in
  hire hour."</p>

  <p>In the third hour afterwards,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Up rose the sonne, and up rose Emelie</p>
      <p>And to the temple of Diane gan hie."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Her prayer also was favourably heard by the deity to whom it was
  addressed; the first hour of Monday (the natural day beginning at
  sunrise) being subject to Luna or Diana. The orisons of Palamon were
  offered two hours earlier, namely, in the twenty-third hour of Sunday,
  which is <span class="correction" title="text reads `smilary'"
  >similarly</span> subject to Venus, the twenty-fourth or last hour
  belonging to Mercury, the planet intermediate between Venus and the Moon.
  It is on this account that Palamon is said to have prayed to Venus in her
  hour.</p>

  <p>Arcite's vows were made later in the day than those of Palamon and
  Emelie. We are told that</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The nexte hour of Mars following this,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>(namely after Emelie's return from the temple of Diana)</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Arcite unto the temple walked is</p>
      <p>Of fierce Mars."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The first hour of Mars is on Monday, the fourth hour of the day; so
  that as the tournament took place in April or May, Arcite went to the
  temple of Mars about eight or nine o'clock.</p>

  <p>It may be well to explain the word "inequal" in the lines&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The thridde hour inequal that Palamon</p>
      <p>Began to Venus temple for to gon,</p>
      <p>Up rose the sonne, and up rose Emelie."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In astrology, the heavens are divided into twelve houses,
  corresponding to a division of the ecliptic into twelve equal parts, the
  first of which is measured from the point of the ecliptic which is on the
  horizon and about to rise above it, at the instant which the astrologer
  has to consider, namely, the instant of birth in the case of a nativity,
  or that in which a journey or any other enterprise is undertaken.</p>

  <p>The hours inequal here spoken of similarly correspond to a division of
  the ecliptic into twenty-four parts, so that each house comprehends the
  portions of the ecliptic belonging to two of these hours, provided the
  division into houses is made at sunrise, when the first hour commences.
  It is obvious that these astrological hours will be of unequal length, as
  equal portions of the ecliptic subtend unequal angles at the pole of the
  equator.</p>

  <p>With regard to the time of year at which the tournament takes place,
  there seems to be an inconsistency. Palamon escapes from prison on the
  3rd of May, and is discovered by Theseus on the 5th. Theseus fixes "this
  day fifty wekes" for the rendezvous at Athens, so that the tournament
  seems to fall in April. Chaucer, however, says that&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Gret was the feste in Athenes thilke day,</p>
      <p>And eke the lusty seson of that May</p>
      <p>Made every wight to be, in swiche pleasance," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Why the 3rd of May is particularly mentioned as the time of Palamon's
  escape, I cannot tell: there is probably some astrological reason. The
  mixture of astrological notions with mythology is curious: "the pale
  Saturnus the colde" is once more a dweller on Olympus, and interposes to
  reconcile Mars and Venus. By his influence Arcite is made to perish after
  having obtained from Mars the fulfilment of his prayer&mdash;</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p>"<i>Snail, Snail, come out of your Hole.</i>"&mdash;In Surrey, and
  most probably in other counties where <!-- Page 133 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>{133}</span>shell-snails abound,
  children amuse themselves by charming them with a chant to put forth
  their horns, of which I have only heard the following couplet, which is
  repeated until it has the desired effect, to the great amusement of the
  charmer.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Snail, snail, come out of your hole,</p>
      <p>Or else I'll beat you as black as a coal."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is pleasant to find that this charm is not peculiar to English
  children, but prevails in places as remote from each other as Naples and
  Silesia.</p>

  <p>The Silesian rhyme is:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Schnecke, schnecke, schnürre!</p>
      <p>Zeig mir dein viere,</p>
      <p>Wenn mir dein viere nicht zeigst,</p>
      <p>Schmeisz ich dich in den Graben,</p>
      <p>Fressen dich die Raben;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>which may be thus paraphrased:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Snail, snail, slug-slow,</p>
      <p>To me thy four horns show;</p>
      <p>If thou dost not show me thy four,</p>
      <p>I will throw thee out of the door,</p>
      <p>For the crow in the gutter,</p>
      <p>To eat for bread and butter."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In that amusing Folk's-book of Neapolitan childish tales, the
  <i>Pentamerone</i> of the noble Count-Palatine Cavalier Giovan-Battista
  Basile, in the seventeenth tale, entitled "La Palomma," we have a similar
  rhyme:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Jesce, jesce, corna;</p>
      <p>Ça mammata te scorna,</p>
      <p>Te scorna 'ncoppa lastrico,</p>
      <p>Che fa lo figlio mascolo."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>of which the sense may probably be:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Peer out! Peer out! Put forth your horns!</p>
      <p>At you your mother mocks and scorns;</p>
      <p>Another son is on the stocks,</p>
      <p>And you she scorns, at you she mocks."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="author"><span class="sc">S. W. Singer.</span>

  <p><i>The Evil Eye.</i>&mdash;This superstition is still prevalent in
  this neighbourhood (Launceston). I have very recently been informed of
  the case of a young woman, in the village of Lifton, who is lying
  hopelessly ill of consumption, which her neighbours attribute to her
  having been "<i>overlooked</i>" (this is the local phrase by which they
  designate the baleful spell of the <i>evil eye</i>). An old woman in this
  town is supposed to have the power of "ill-wishing" or bewitching her
  neighbours and their cattle, and is looked on with much awe in
  consequence.</p>

  <p class="author">H. G. T.

  <p>"<i>Millery! Millery! Dousty-poll!</i>" &amp;c.&mdash;I am told by a
  neighbour of a cruel custom among the children in Somersetshire, who,
  when they have caught a certain kind of large white moth, which they call
  a <i>miller</i>, chant over it this uncouth ditty:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Millery! Millery! <i>Dousty</i>-poll!</p>
      <p>How many sacks hast thou stole?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And then, with boyish recklessness, put the poor creature to death for
  the imagined misdeeds of his human namesake.</p>

  <p class="author">H. G. T.

  <p><i>"Nettle in, Dock out."</i>&mdash;Sometime since, turning over the
  leaves of Clarke's <i>Chaucer</i>, I stumbled on the following passage in
  "Troilus and Cressida," vol. ii. p. 104.:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Thou biddest me that I should love another</p>
      <p>All freshly newe, and let Creseidé go,</p>
      <p>It li'th not in my power levé brother,</p>
      <p>And though I might, yet would I not do so:</p>
      <p>But can'st thou playen racket to and fro,</p>
      <p><i>Nettle' in Dock out</i>, now this now that, Pandare?</p>
      <p>Now foulé fall her for thy woe that care."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I was delighted to find the charm for a nettle sting, so familiar to
  my childish ear, was as old as Chaucer's time, and exceedingly surprised
  to stumble on the following note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This appears to be a proverbial expression implying inconstancy; but
  the origin of the phrase is unknown to all the commentators on our
  poet."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If this be the case, Chaucer's commentators may as well be told that
  children in Northumberland use friction by a dock-leaf as the approved
  remedy for the sting of a nettle, or rather the approved charm; for the
  patient, while rubbing in the dock-juice, should keep
  repeating,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Nettle in, dock out,</p>
      <p>Dock in, nettle out,</p>
      <p>Nettle in, dock out,</p>
      <p>Dock rub nettle out."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The meaning is therefore obvious. Troilus is indignant at being
  recommended to forget this Cressida for a new love, just as a child cures
  a nettle-sting by a dock-leaf. I know not whether you will deem this
  trifle worth a corner in your valuable and amusing "<span

  </div>
  <p>The Scaligers are well known, not only as having held the lordship of
  Verona for some generations, but also as having been among the friends of
  Dante in his exile, no mean reputation in itself; and, at a later period,
  as taking very high rank among the first scholars of their day. To which
  of them the passage above properly belongs&mdash;whether to Can Grande,
  or his brother Bartolommeo, or even his father Alberto, commentators are
  by no means agreed. The question is argued more largely than
  conclusively, both in the notes to Lombardi's edition, and also in Ugo
  Foscolo's <i>Discorso nel testo di Dante</i>.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the following may be a contribution to the evidence in favour
  of Can Grande. After <!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page134"></a>{134}</span>saying, in a letter, in which he professes
  to give the history and origin of his family,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Prisca omnium familiarum Scaligeræ stirpis insignia sunt, aut
  <i>Scala singularis</i>, aut Canes utrinque scalæ innitentes."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Joseph Scaliger adds&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Denique principium Veronensium progenitores eadem habuerunt insignia:
  <i>donec</i> in eam familiam Alboinus et <i>Canis Magnus</i> Aquilam
  imperii cum Scala primum ab Henrico VII<sup>o</sup>, deinde à Ludovico
  Bavaro acceptam nobis reliquerunt."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Alboinus, however, who received this grant upon being made a
  Lieutenant of the Empire, and having the Signory of Verona made
  hereditary in his family, only bore the eagle "<i>in quadrante
  scuti</i>."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sed Canis Magnus, cum eidem à Cæsare Ludovico Bavaro idem privilegium
  confirmatum esset, totum scutum Aquilâ occupavit, <i>subjectâ Alitis
  pedibus Scalâ</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Can Grande, then, was surely the first who carried the "santo uccello"
  <i>in su</i> la Scala; and his epithet of Grande would also agree best
  with Dante's words, as neither his father nor brothers seem to have had
  the same claim to it.</p>

  <p>I would offer a farther remark about this same title or epithet Can
  Grande, and the origin of the scala or ladder as a charge upon the shield
  or coat of this family. Cane would at first sight appear to be a
  designation borrowed from the animal of that name. There would be
  parallels enough in Italy and elsewhere, as the Ursini, Lewis the Lion
  (VIII. of France), our own C&oelig;ur de Lion, and Harold Harefoot.
  Dante, too, refers to him under the name "Il Veltro," <i>Inferno</i>,
  canto 1. l. 101. But Joseph Scaliger, in the letter to which I referred
  before, gives the following account of it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Nomen illi fuerat <i>Franscisco</i>, à sacro lavacro, <i>Cani</i> à
  gentilitate, <i>Magno</i> à merito rerum gestarum. Neque enim
  <i>Canis</i> ab illo <i>latranti animali</i> dictus est, ut recte monet
  Jovius, sed quod linguâ Windorum, unde principes Veronenses oriundos
  vult, <i>Cahan</i> idem est, quod linguâ Serviana <i>Kral</i>, id est
  Rex, aut Princeps. Nam in gente nostrâ multi fuerunt Canes, Mastini,
  Visulphi Guelphi."&mdash;P. 17.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This letter consists of about 58 pages, and stands first in the
  edition of 1627. It is addressed "ad Janum Dousam," and was written to
  vindicate his family from certain indignities which he conceived had been
  put upon it. Sansovino and Villani, it appears, had referred its origin
  to Mastin II., "qui," to use Scaliger's version of the matter,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Qui primus dictator populi Veronensis perpetuus creatus est, quem et
  <i>auctorem</i> nobilitatis Scaligeræ et <i>Scalarum</i> antea
  <i>fabrum</i> impudentissime nugantur hostes virtutis majorum
  nostrorum."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It was bad enough to ascribe their origin to so recent a date, but to
  derive it from a mere mechanic was more than our author's patience could
  endure. Accordingly he is not sparing of invective against those who so
  disparage his race.</p>

  <p><i>Vappa</i>, <i>nebulo</i>, and similar terms, are freely applied to
  their characters; <i>invidia</i>, <span title="kakoêtheia" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&kappa;&omicron;&#x1F75;&theta;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;</span>,
  &amp;c., to their motives. The following is a specimen of the way he
  handles them:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Dantes Poëta illustrissimum Christianissimorum Regum Franciæ genus à
  laniis Parisiensibus deducit, utique tam vere, quam ille tenebrio nostrum
  à scalarum fabro: quas mirum, ni auctor generis <i>in suspendium eorum
  parabat</i>, quos vaticinabatur illustri nobilitate suæ
  obtrectaturos."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now the charge of a ladder upon their shield was certainly borne by
  the several branches of this family long before any of them became
  masters of Verona; and I should suggest that it originated in some
  brilliant escalade of one of the first members of it. Thus, of course, it
  would remind us all of perhaps the earliest thing of the kind&mdash;I
  mean the shield and bearings of Eteoclus before Thebes:</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Ayot St. Lawrence Church</i> (Vol. iii., pp. 39. 102.). Ayot St.
  Lawrence, Herts, is another deserted church, like that of
  Landwade,&mdash;in fact a ruin, with its monuments disgracefully exposed.
  I was so astonished at seeing it in 1850, that I would now ask the reason
  of its having been allowed to fall into such distress, and how any one
  could have had the power to build the present Greek one, instead of
  restoring its early Decorated neighbour. I did not observe the 2 ft. 3
  in. effigy alluded to in <i>Arch. Journ.</i> iii. 239., but particularly
  noted the elegant sculpture on the chancel arch capital.</p>

  <p>I would suggest to Mr. Kelke, that the incumbents of parishes should
  keep a separate register, recording <i>all</i> monuments, &amp;c. as they
  are put up, as existing, or as found in MS. church notes, or published in
  county histories. In the majority of parishes the trouble of so doing
  would be trifling, and to many a pleasant occupation.</p>

  <p><i>The King's Messengers, by the Rev. W. Adams.</i>&mdash;Ought it not
  to be remarked, in future editions of this charming and highly poetical
  book (which has lately been translated into Swedish), that it is grounded
  on one of the "examples" occurring in <i>Barlaam and Josaphat</i>?"</p>

  <p>In the third or fourth century, an Indian prince names Josaphat was
  converted to Christianity by a holy hermit called Barlaam. This subject
  was afterwards treated of by some Alexandrian priest, probably in the
  sixth century, in a beautiful tale, legend, or spiritual romance, in
  Greek, and in a style of great ease, beauty, warmth, and colouring. The
  work was afterwards attributed to Johannes Damascenus, who died in 760.
  In this half-Asiatic Christian prose epic, Barlaam employs a number of
  even then ancient folk-tales and fables, spiritually interpreted, in
  Josaphat's conversion. It is on the fifth of these "examples" that Mr.
  Adams has built his richly-glittering fairy palace.</p>

  <p><i>Barlaam and Josaphat</i> was translated into almost <!-- Page 136
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>{136}</span>every European
  dialect during the Middle Age, sometimes in verse, but usually in prose,
  and became an admired folk-book. Among the versions lately recovered I
  may mention one into Old-Swedish (a shorter one, published in my
  <i>Old-Swedish Legendarium</i>, and a longer one, not yet published); and
  one in Old-Norwegian, from a vellum MS. of the thirteenth century,
  shortly to appear in Christiania.</p>

  <p><i>Cause of Rarity of William IV.'s Copper Coinage.</i>&mdash;The
  copper coinage of William IV. is become so scarce, that possibly a doubt
  may some day arise, whether any but a very limited issue of it was ever
  made; it may be well, therefore, to introduce a <i>note</i> on the cause
  of its disappearance, while the subject is comparatively recent.</p>

  <p>When the copper coins of the last reign appeared, a slight tinge in
  the colour of the metal excited the suspicion of those accustomed to
  examine such things, that it contained gold, which proved to be the fact;
  hence their real value was greater than that for which they passed
  current, and they were speedily collected and melted down by
  manufacturers, principally, I believe, as an alloy to gold, whereby every
  particle of that metal which they contained was turned to account. I have
  been told that various Birmingham establishments had agents in different
  parts of the country, appointed to collect this coinage.</p>

  <p><i>Burnet.</i>&mdash;In the list of conflicting judgments on Burnet,
  quoted by your correspondents (Vol. i., pp. 40. 120. 181. 341. 493.), I
  find no reference to the opinion of his contemporary, Bishop Nicolson.
  That writer takes a somewhat partial view of the character and merits of
  the historian, and canvasses, by anticipation, much of what has been
  urged against him by our more modern critics. But, as the weight of
  authorities already cited appears to militate against Burnet, I am
  induced to send you some of Bishop Nicolson's remarks, for the sake of
  those readers who may not have immediate access to them. I quote from his
  <i>English Historical Library</i>, 2nd edition, p. 119.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the months of December and January in the year following (1680),
  the historian (G. Burnet) had the thanks of both Houses of Parliament for
  what he had already done; and was desired to proceed to the finishing of
  the whole work, which was done accordingly. This historian gives a
  punctual account of all the affairs of the Reformation, from its first
  beginning in the reign of Henry VIII., till it was finally completed and
  settled by Queen Elizabeth, <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1559. And the
  whole is penned in such a masculine style as becomes an historian, and
  such as is this author's property in all his writings. The collection of
  records which he gives in the conclusion of each volume are good vouchers
  of the truth of all he delivers (as such) in the body of his history; and
  are much more perfect than could reasonably be expected, after the pains
  taken, in Queen Mary's days, to suppress everything that carried the
  marks of the Reformation upon it. The work has had so much justice done
  it, as to meet with a general acceptance abroad, and to be translated
  into most of the European languages; insomuch that even the most piquant
  of the author's enemies allow it to have a <i>reputation firmly and
  deservedly established</i>. Indeed, some of the French writers have
  cavilled at it; but the most eminent of them (M. Varillas and M. Le
  Grand) have received due correction from the author himself."</p>

  mind and manner, which fitted Steele and Addison to be the inimitable
  <i>arbitri elegantiarum</i> of English society, there can be no
  doubt,"&mdash;Coleridge wrote in the margin of his copy, "I doubt this,
  particularly in respect to Addison, and think I could select from Defoe's
  writings a volume equal in size to Addison's collected papers, little
  inferior in wit and humour, and greatly superior in vigor of style and
  thought."</p>

  <p><i>Miller's "Philosophy of Modern History."</i>&mdash;In the memoir,
  chiefly autobiographical, prefixed to the last edition (published by Mr.
  Bohn, 1848-9) of this most able and interesting work, we find the
  following words, p. xxxv.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the preceding period of my lecturing, I collected a moderate
  audience [seldom exceeding ten persons] in the Law School [his friend,
  Alexander Knox, being always one], sufficient to encourage me, or at
  least to permit me, to persevere, but not to animate my exertions by
  publicity. But as I was approaching the sixteenth century, the number of
  my hearers <!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page137"></a>{137}</span>increased so much, that I was encouraged
  to remove to the Examination Hall, from which time my lectures attracted
  a large portion of public attention, strangers forming a considerable
  portion of the auditory."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is worthy of remark, in connexion with this production of a
  highly-gifted scholar and divine, whose name does honour to Trinity
  College, Dublin, that Dr. Sullivan's <i>Lectures on the Constitution and
  Laws of England</i>, which have since deservedly acquired so much fame,
  were delivered in presence of only <i>three</i> individuals, Dr. Michael
  Kearney and two others&mdash;surely no great encouragement to Irish
  genius! In fact, the Irish long seemed unconscious of the merits of two
  considerable works by sons of their own university,&mdash;Hamilton's
  <i>Conic Sections</i> and Sullivan's <i>Lectures</i>; and hesitated to
  praise, until the incense of fame arose to one from the literary altars
  of Cambridge, and an English judge, Sir William Blackstone, authorised
  the other.</p>

  <p>In the memoir to which I have referred, we find a complete list of the
  many publications which Dr. Miller, "distinguished for his services in
  theology and literature," sent forth from the press. We are likewise
  informed that there are some unpublished letters from Hannah More,
  Alexander Knox, and other distinguished characters, with whom Dr. Miller
  was in the habit of corresponding.</p>

  <p><i>Anticipations of Modern Ideas or Inventions.</i>&mdash;In Vol.
  iii., pp. 62. 69., are two interesting instances of this sort. In
  Wilson's <i>Life of Defoe</i>, he gives the titles of two works which I
  have often sought in vain, and which he classes amongst the writings of
  that voluminous author. They run thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Augusta triumphans</i>, or the way to make London the most
  flourishing city in the universe. I. By establishing a university where
  gentlemen may have an academical education under the eye of their friends
  [<i>the London University anticipated</i>]. II. To prevent much murder,
  &amp;c., by an hospital for foundlings. III. By suppressing pretended
  madhouses, where many of the fair sex are unjustly confin'd while their
  husbands keep mistresses, and many widows are lock'd up for the sake of
  their jointures. IV. To save our youth from destruction by suppressing
  gaming tables, and Sunday debauches. V. To avoid the expensive
  importation of foreign musicians by promoting an academy of our own,
  [<i>Anticipation of the Royal Academy of Music</i>], &amp;c. &amp;c.
  London: T. Warner. 1728. 8vo."</p>

  <p>"<i>Second Thoughts are Best</i>; or a further Improvement of a late
  Scheme to prevent Street Robberies, by which our Streets will be so
  strongly guarded and so gloriously illuminated, that any Part of London
  will be as safe and pleasant at Midnight as at Noonday; and Burglary
  totally impracticable [<i>a remarkable anticipation of the present state
  of things in the principal thoroughfares</i>]. With some Thoughts for
  suppressing Robberies in all the Public Roads of England [<i>rural police
  anticipated</i>]. Humbly offer'd for the Good of his Country, submitted
  to the Consideration of Parliament, and dedicated to his Sacred Majesty
  Geo. II., by Andrew Moreton, Esq. [supposed to be an assumed name; a
  common practice of De Foe's]. London. W. Meadows, 1729."</p>

  <p class="author">R. D. H.

  <p>"<i>Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon!</i>"&mdash;The above text is
  often quoted as not being in accordance with the present state of our
  astronomical knowledge, and many well-known commentators on the Bible
  have adopted the same opinion.</p>

  <p>I find Kitto, in the <i>Pictorial Bible</i>, characterising it as "an
  example of those bold metaphors and poetical forms of expression with
  which the Scriptures abound." Scott (edit. 1850) states that "it would
  have been improper that he (Joshua) should speak, or that the miracle
  should be recorded according to the terms of modern astronomy."</p>

  <p>Mant (edit. 1830) says: "It is remarkable that the terms in which this
  event is recorded do not agree with what is now known rewarding the
  motion of the heavenly bodies."</p>

  <p>Is it certain that Joshua's words are absolutely at variance and
  irreconcileable with the present state of astronomical knowledge?
  Astronomers allow that the sun is the centre and governing principle of
  our system, and that it revolves on its axis. What readier means, then,
  could Joshua have found for staying the motion of our planet, than by
  commanding the revolving centre, in its inseparable connexion with all
  planetary motion, to stand still?</p>

  <p><i>Langley's Polidore Vergile.</i>&mdash;At the back of the title of a
  copy of Langley's <i>Abridgement of Polidore Vergile</i>, 8vo., Lond.
  1546, seen by Hearne in 1719, was the following MS. note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>At the end of the dedication to Sir Ant. Denny is also written:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Robert Wyllyams Boke, bowgyt by John Darby at Oesforth, and brot to
  Seynbury."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Seynbury here mentioned was doubtless Saintbury in
  Gloucestershire, on the borders of Worcestershire, near Chipping Campden,
  and about four miles distant from Evesham.</p>

  <p class="author">P. B.

  <p><i>Luther and Ignatius Loyola.</i>&mdash;A parallel or counterpoising
  view of these two characters has been quoted in several publications,
  some of recent date; but in all it is attributed to a wrong source. Mr.
  M<sup>c</sup>Gavin, in his <i>Protestant</i>, Letter CXL., (p. 582, ed.
  1846); Mr. Overbury, in his <i>Jesuits</i> (Lond. 1846), p. 8., and, of
  course, the authority from which he borrows, Poynder's <i>History of the
  Jesuits</i>; and Dr. Dowling's <i>Romanism</i>, p. 473. <!-- Page 138
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>{138}</span>(ed. New York,
  1849)&mdash;all these give, as the authority for the contrasted
  characters quoted, Damian's <i>Synopsis Societatis Jesu</i>. Nothing of
  the kind appears <i>there</i>; but in the <i>Imago primi Sæculi Soc.
  Jesu</i>, 1640, it will be found, p. 19.</p>

  <p>The misleader of these writers seems to have been Villers, in his
  <i>Prize Essay on the Reformation</i>, or his annotator, Mills, p.
  374.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Novus</span>.

  <p>P.S. (Vol. ii., p. 375.).&mdash;The lines quoted by Dr. Pusey, I have
  some notion, belong to a Romish, not a Socinian, writer.</p>

  <p><i>Winkel.</i>&mdash;I thought, some time since, that the places
  bearing this name in England, were taken from the like German word,
  signifying <i>a corner</i>. I find, on examination, that there is a
  village in Rhenish Prussia named "Winkel." It seems that Charlemagne had
  a wine-cellar there; so that that word is no doubt taken from the German
  words <i>wein</i> and <i>keller</i>, from the Latin <i>vinum</i> and
  <i>cella</i>.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Aredjid Kooez</span>.

  <p><i>Foreign Renderings.</i>&mdash;In addition to those given, I will
  add the following, which I once came across at Salzburg:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"George Nelböck recommande l'hôtel aux <i>Trois Alliés</i>, vis-à-vis
  de la maison paternelle du célèbre Mozart, lequel est nouvellement fourni
  et offre tous les comforts à Mrs. les voyageurs."</p>

  <p>Translated as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"George Nelböck begs leave to <i>recommand</i> his hotel to the Three
  Allied, situated <i>vis-à-vis</i> of the birth house of Mozart, which
  offers all comforts to the <i>meanest</i> charges."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Also the following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"M. Reutlinger (of Frankfort on Main) <i>takes</i> leave to
  <i>recommande</i> his well furnished magazine of all kind of
  travelling-luggage and <i>sadle</i>-works."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Aredjid Kooez</span>.

  <p><i>Samuel Johnson&mdash;Gilbert Wakefield.</i>&mdash;Whoever has had
  much to do with the press will sympathise with <span class="sc">Mr.
  Charles Knight</span> in all that he has stated ("<span class="sc">Notes
  and Queries</span>," Vol. iii., p. 62.) respecting the
  accidental&mdash;but not at first discovered&mdash;substitution of
  <i>modern</i> for <i>moderate</i>. If that word <i>modern</i> had not
  been detected till it was too late for an explanation on authority, what
  strange conjectures would have been the consequence! Happily, <span
  class="sc">Mr. Knight</span> was at hand to remove that
  stumbling-block.</p>

  <p>I rather fancy that I can rescue Samuel Johnson from the fangs of
  Gilbert Wakefield, by the supposition of an error of the press. In 1786,
  Wakefield published an edition of Gray's <i>Poems</i>, with notes; and in
  the last note on Gray's "Ode on the Death of a Cat," he thus animadverts
  on Dr. Johnson:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Our critic exposes himself to reproof from the manner in which he has
  conveyed his severe remark: <i>show a rhyme is sometimes made</i>. The
  omission of the relative, a too common practice with our writers, is an
  impropriety of the grossest kind: and which <i>neither gods or men</i>,
  as one expresses himself, nor any language under heaven, can endure."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now in Dr. Johnson's <i>Life of Gray</i>, we find this
  sentence:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the first stanza 'the azure flowers that blow' show resolutely a
  rhyme is sometimes made when it cannot easily be found."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>My notion is, that the word <i>how</i> has been omitted in the
  printing, from the similarity of blow, show, how; and thus the sentence
  will be&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>The azure flowers that blow</i> show how resolutely a rhyme is
  sometimes made when it cannot easily be found."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But Gilbert Wakefield was a critic by profession, and apparently as
  great in English as he was in Greek.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL QUERIES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(<i>Continued from</i> Vol. iii., p. 87.)</p>

  <p>(39.) Does any one now feel inclined to vindicate for Inchofer,
  Scioppius, Bariac, or Contarini, the authorship of the <i>Monarchia
  Solipsorum</i>? Notwithstanding the testimony of the Venice edition of
  1652, as well as the very abundant evidence of successive witnesses, in
  favour of the first-named writer, (whose claim has been recognised so
  lately as the year 1790, by the <i>Indice Ultimo</i> of Madrid), can
  there be the smallest doubt that the veritable inventor of this satire
  upon the Jesuits was their former associate, <span
  class="sc">Jules-Clement Scotti</span>? For the interpretation of his
  pseudonyme, "Lucius Cornelius Europæus," see Niceron, <i>Mém.</i> xxxix.
  70-1.</p>

  <p>(40.) Mr. Cureton (<i>Ant. Syr. vers. of Ep. of S. Ignat.</i> Preface,
  p. ii., Lond. 1845) has asserted that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The first Epistles published, bearing the name of St.
  Ignatius&mdash;one to the Holy Virgin, and two to the Apostle St. John,
  in Latin,&mdash;were printed in the year 1495. Three years later there
  appeared an edition of eleven Epistles, also in Latin, attributed to the
  same <!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page139"></a>{139}</span>holy Martyr. But nearly seventy years more
  elapsed before any edition of these Epistles in Greek was printed. In
  1557, Val. Paceus published twelve," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Two connected Queries may be founded upon this statement:&mdash;(1.)
  Is not Mr. Cureton undoubtedly in error with respect to the year 1495?
  for, if we may believe Orlandi, Maittaire, Fabricius (<i>B. G.</i>), and
  Ceillier, the three Latin Epistles above named had been set forth
  previously at Cologne, in 1478. (2.) By what mysterious species of
  arithmetic can it be demonstrated that "nearly <i>seventy</i> years"
  elapsed between 1498 and 1557? The process must be a somewhat similar one
  to that by which "<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 360" is made equivalent
  to "five-and-<i>twenty</i> years after the Council of Nice." (Pref., p.
  xxxiv.) In the former instance "<i>seventy</i>" is hardly a literal
  translation of Bishop Pearson's "<i>sexaginta</i>:" but whether these
  miscalculations have been already adverted to, and subsequently amended,
  or not, I cannot tell.</p>

  <p>(41.) In the same Preface (p. xxiv.) a very strange argument was put
  forward, which, as we may learn from the last <i>Quarterly Review</i>, p.
  79., where it is satisfactorily refuted, has been since repeated by Mr.
  Cureton. He maintains that the Syriac text of the Ignatian Epistles
  cannot be an epitome, because that "we know of no instances of such
  abridgment in any Christian writer." To commence with the West,&mdash;is
  not Mr. Cureton acquainted with the manner in which Rufinus dealt with
  the <i>History</i> of Eusebius? Have we here no specimens of
  abbreviation; no allusion in the prologue to "omissis quæ videbantur
  superflua?" Has Mr. C. never looked into that memorable combination of
  the independent works of three contemporaries, entitled <i>Historia
  Tripartita?</i> and, not to wander from the strictest bounds of
  bibliography, will any one presume to boast of having a copy of this book
  printed prior to that now near me, (a spectacle which De Bure could never
  get a sight of), "per Iohannem Schüszler regie vrbis Augustensis ciuem,"
  anno 1472? But let us go to the East in search of compendiums. Did not
  Theodorus Lector, early in the sixth century, reduce into a harmony the
  compositions of Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret? How does Assemani speak
  of the first two <span class="correction" title="text reads `patts'"
  >parts</span> of the Ecclesiastical History of Zacharias Rhetor, supposed
  to have been written <i>in Syriac</i>, about the year 540? "Prima est
  <i>epitome</i> Socratis, altera Theodoreti." (<i>Biblioth. Orient.</i>,
  tom. ii. cap. vii.) On this occasion, manifestly, ancient records are
  encountered in an abridged Syriac form; a circumstance which will not
  strengthen the Curetonian theory relative to the text of the Ignatian
  Epistles. Again, bearing in mind the resemblance that exists between
  passages in the interpolated Epistles and in the Apostolic Constitutions,
  with the latter of which the <i>Didascalia</i> of Ignatius seems to have
  been commingled, let us inquire, Did not Dr. Grabe, in his <i>Essay upon
  the Doctrine of the Apostles</i>, published in 1711, unanswerably prove
  that the <i>Syriac</i> copy of this <i>Didascalia</i> was much more
  contracted than the <i>Arabic</i> one, or than the <i>Greek</i>
  Constitutions of the Apostles? Is it not true that extracted portions of
  these Constitutions are found in some old MS. collections of Canons? Has
  not Cotelier furnished us with an "<i>Epitome</i>," compiled by
  Metaphrastes from Clementine counterfeits, concerning the life of S.
  Peter? And, to descend from the tenth to the sixteenth century, are we
  not indebted to Carolus Capellius for an "<i>Epitome Apostolicarum
  Constitutionum, in Creta insula repertarum</i>," 4to., Ingolstad.
  1546?</p>

  <p>(42.) When <span class="sc">Mr Merryweather</span> (Vol. iii., p. 60.)
  was seeking for monastic notices of extreme longevity, did he always find
  it feasible to meet with Ingulphus's History of Croyland Abbey "<i>apud
  Wharton, Anglia Sacra</i>, 613?" and if it be not enough to have read an
  account of an ecclesiastic who is said to have attained to the delectable
  age of 168 years, is it not questionable that anything will suffice
  except it be the narrative of the <i>Seven Sleepers</i>? The third
  "Lectio" relating to these Champions of Christendom, as it is given in a
  Vatican MS., makes the period of their slumber to have been about 370
  years. Who was the author of that finely-printed and illustrated quarto
  volume, the <i>Sanctorum Septem Dormientium Historia, ex Ectypis Musei
  Victorii expressa</i>, published, with the full approbation of the
  Censors, Romæ, 1741? "Obscurus esse gestio" is his declaration about
  himself (p. 63.). Has he remained incognito?</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE'S "ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA."</h3>

  <p>The first scene of the third act of Shakspeare's play of "Antony and
  Cleopatra," at first sight, appears to be totally unconnected with what
  goes before and what follows. It may be observed that the dramas founded
  on the Roman history are much more regular in their construction than
  those founded on the English history. Indeed, with respect to the drama
  in question, I am not aware of any scene, with the exception of that I
  have mentioned, which does not bear more or less on the fortunes of the
  personages from whom the play derives its name. Hence I am led to
  conjecture that the dramatist here alludes to some event of the day,
  which was well known to his audience. The speech of Ventidius seems to
  point to something of the kind:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i10hg3">"O Silius, Silius!</p>
      <p>I have done enough: a lower place, note well,</p>
      <p>May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;</p>
      <p>Better leave undone, than by our deed acquire</p>
      <p>Too high a fame, when him we serve's away," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Some of your numerous readers will doubtless <!-- Page 140 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>{140}</span>be able to inform me
  whether there is any instance in the annals of that age of an inferior
  officer outshining his superior, and being cashiered or neglected in
  consequence.</p>

  <p>Malone assigns to the play the date of 1608.</p>

<h3>GREENE'S "GROATSWORTH OF WITTE."</h3>

  <p>The interesting article by the <span class="sc">Hermit of
  Holyport</span>, on the early German translation of Greene's <i>Quip for
  an Upstart Courtier</i>, will, I am sure, be read with attention by all
  lovers of our early literature. My object in addressing you on the
  subject is to draw the attention of your foreign correspondents, and
  perhaps the notice of your new contemporary, to the great importance of
  discovering whether the <i>Groatsworth of Witte</i> was also translated
  into German. The earliest edition I have seen is that of 1617, but it was
  printed as early as 1592; and I have long been curious to ascertain
  whether the remarkable passage respecting Shakspeare has descended to us
  in its genuine state. In the absence of the English edition of 1592, this
  information might be obtained from a translation published before 1617.
  Perhaps, however, some of your readers may be able to point out the
  existence of an earlier edition. I have sought for that of 1592 for
  several years without any success.</p>

  <p><i>Sangaree.</i>&mdash;Your periodical having been the means of
  eliciting some interesting particulars respecting the origin of the word
  <i>grog</i>, perhaps you will allow me to claim a similar distinction for
  the word <i>sangaree</i>. You are aware that this word is applied, in the
  West Indies, to a beverage composed of Madeira wine, syrup, water, and
  nutmeg. The French call it <i>sangris</i>, in allusion, it is supposed,
  to the colour of the beverage, which when mixed has the appearance, as it
  were, of grey blood <i>(sang gris)</i>: but as there is reason to believe
  that the English were the first to introduce the use of the thing, they
  having been the first to introduce its principal ingredient, Madeira
  wine, I am disposed to look upon <i>sangaree</i> as the original word,
  and <i>sangris</i> as nothing more than a corruption of it. Can any of
  your readers (among whom I trust there are many retired West India
  planters) give the etymology of this word?</p>

  46.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Juliana, &amp;c., tenuit dimidiam hidam terræ, &amp;c., per

  <p>Blount's explanation of <i>Canes lesos</i>, is "leash hounds or park
  hounds, such as draw after a hurt deer in a leash, or liam;" but is there
  any reason why we should not adopt the more simple rendering of "hurt
  hounds;" and suppose that Dame Juliana was matron of the Royal Dorset Dog
  Hospital?</p>

  <p>Ducange gives no such word as <i>lesus</i>; neither does he nor any

  <i>clanctura</i>. I trust, however, that some of your correspondents

  designated "<i>Eustacius Abbe Flamoei</i>." Also witnessed by Willo'

  to be found among Ascough's Col., B. M.</p>

  <i>Angodus</i> be German, Norman, or Saxon. Angodus de Lindsei grants a

  not monumental; and another (but more like a tomb) at Merton, near

  sepulchre on the north, in the same church?</p>

  <p><i>Closing of Rooms on account of Death.</i>&mdash;In the
  <i>Spectator</i>, No. 110., July, 1711, one of Addison's papers on Sir
  Roger de Coverley, the following passage occurs:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"My friend, Sir Roger, has often told me with a good deal of mirth,
  that at his first coming to his estate he found three parts of his house
  altogether useless; that the best room in it had the reputation of being
  haunted, and by that means was locked up; that noises had been heard in
  his long gallery, so that he could not get a servant to enter it after
  eight o'clock at night; that the door of one of his chambers was nailed
  up, because there went a story in the family that a butler had formerly
  hanged himself in it; and that his mother, who lived to a great age, had
  shut up half the rooms in the house, in which either her husband, a son,
  <!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page143"></a>{143}</span>or daughter had died. The knight seeing
  his habitation reduced to so small a compass, and himself in a manner
  shut out of his own house, upon the death of his mother ordered all the
  apartments to be flung open, and exorcised by his chaplain, who lay in
  every room one after another, and by that means dissipated the fears
  which had so long reigned in the family."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The practice of shutting up rooms in which members of the family had
  died was retained up to the end of the last century. I learn from a
  friend that, in a country house in the south of England, his mother's
  apartment, consisting of a sitting-room, bed-room, and dressing-room, was
  closed at her death in 1775. The room in which his grandfather had died
  in 1760 was likewise closed. These four rooms were kept locked up, with
  the shutters shut, till the year 1793, when the next owner came into
  possession, who opened them, and caused them to be again used. Probably
  other cases of the same sort may be known to your correspondents, as
  having occurred in the last century; but the custom appears to be now
  extinct.</p>

<h3>THE EPISCOPAL MITRE AND PAPAL TIARA.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 62.)</p>

  <p>In answer to the question of an "<span class="sc">Inquirer</span>"
  respecting the origin of the peculiar form and first use of the episcopal
  mitre, I take the liberty of suggesting that it will be found to be of
  Oriental extraction, and to have descended from that country, either
  directly, or through the medium of other nations, to the ecclesiastics of
  Christian Rome. The writers of the Romish, as well as Reformed Churches,
  now admit, that most, if not all, of the external symbols, whether of
  dress or ceremonial pageantry, exhibited by the Roman Catholic
  priesthood, were adopted from the Pagans, under the plea of being
  "indifferent in themselves, and applicable as symbolical in their own
  rites and usages" (Marangoni, <i>Delle cose gentili e profane trasportate
  nel uso ed ornamento delle chiesi</i>); in the same manner as many Romish
  customs were retained at the Reformation for the purpose of inducing the
  Papists to "come in," and conform to the other changes then made
  (Southey, <i>History of the Church</i>). Thus, while the disciples of Dr.
  Pusey extract their forms and symbols from the practices of Papal Rome,
  the disciples of the Pope deduce theirs from the practices of Pagan
  Rome.</p>

  <p>With this preface I proceed to show that the episcopal <i>mitre</i>
  and the papal <i>tiara</i> are respectively the copies each of a distinct
  head-dress originally worn by the kings of Persia and the conterminous
  countries, and by the chiefs of their priesthood, the Magi. The
  nomenclature alone indicates a foreign extraction. It comes to us through
  the Romans from the Greeks; both of which nations employed the terms
  <span title="mitra" class="grk">&mu;&#x1F77;&tau;&rho;&alpha;</span>,
  Lat. <i>mitra</i>, and <span title="tiara" class="grk"
  >&tau;&iota;&#x1F71;&rho;&alpha;</span>, Lat. <i>tiara</i>, to designate
  two different kinds of covering for the head in use amongst the Oriental
  races, each one of a distinct and peculiar form, though as being
  foreigners, and consequently not possessing the technical accuracy of a
  native, they not unfrequently confound the two words, and apply them
  indiscriminately to both objects. Strictly speaking, the Greek <span
  title="mitra" class="grk">&mu;&#x1F77;&tau;&rho;&alpha;</span>, in its
  primitive notion, means a long <i>scarf</i>, whence it came to signify,
  in a secondary sense, various articles of attire composed with a scarf,
  and amongst others the Oriental <i>turban</i> (Herod. vii. 62.). But as
  we descend in time, and remove in distance from the country where this
  object was worn, we find that the Romans affixed another notion to the
  word, which they used very commonly to designate the Asiatic or Phrygian
  cap (Virg. <i>Æn.</i> iv. 216.; Servius, l.c.); and this sense has
  likewise been adopted in our own language:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"That Paris now with his unmanly sort,</p>
      <p>With <i>mitred</i> hat."&mdash;Surrey, Virgil, <i>Æn.</i> iv.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Thus the word <i>mitra</i> in its later usage came to signify a
  <i>cap</i> or <i>bonnet</i>, instead of a turban; and it is needless to
  observe that the priests of a religion comparatively modern, when they
  adopted the term, would have taken it in the sense which was current at
  their own day. Now, though the common people were not permitted to wear
  high bonnets, nor of any other than a soft and flexible material, the
  kings and personages of distinction had theirs of a lofty form, and
  stiffened for the express purpose of making them stand up at an imposing
  elevation above the crown of the head. In the national collection at
  Paris there is preserved an antique gem, engraved by Caylus (<i>Recueil
  d'Antiq.</i>, vol. ii. p. 124.), on which is engraved the head of some
  Oriental personage, probably a king of Parthia, Persia, or Armenia, who
  wears a tall upstanding bonnet, <i>mitred</i> at the top exactly like a
  bishop's, with the exception that it has three incisions at the side
  instead of a single one. These separate incisions had no doubt a
  symbolical meaning amongst the native races, although their allusive
  properties are unknown to us; but it is not an unwarrantable inference,
  nor inconsistent with the customs of these nations as enduring at this
  day, to conclude that the numbers of one, two, or three, were
  appropriated as distinctions of different degrees in rank; and that their
  priests, the Magi, like those of other countries where the sovereign did
  not invest himself with priestly dignities, imitated the habiliments as
  they assumed the powers of the sovereign, and wore a bonnet closely
  resembling his in form and dignity, with the difference of one large
  <i>mitre</i> at each side, in place of the three smaller ones.</p>

  <p>If this account be true respecting the origin of the mitre, it will
  lead us by an easy step to determine the place where it was first
  used&mdash;at Antioch, the "Queen of the East," where, as we are told in
  the Acts of the Apostles, the followers of Christ were first called
  "Christians;" thus indicating that they were sufficiently numerous and
  influential to be distinguished as a separate class in that city, while
  those in Rome yet remained despised and unknown. Antioch was the imperial
  residence of the Macedonian dynasty, which succeeded Alexander, who
  himself assumed the upright bonnet of the Persian king (Arrian. iv. 7.),
  and transmitted it to his successors, who ruled over Syria for several
  hundred years, where its form would be ready at hand as a model
  emblematic of authority for the bishop who ruled over the primitive
  church in those parts.</p>

  <p>The tiara of the popes has, in like manner, an Eastern origin; but
  instead of being adopted by them directly from its native birth-place, it
  descended through Etruria to the Pagan priesthood of ancient Rome, and
  thence to the head of the Roman Catholic Church. The <span title="tiara" class="grk"
  >&tau;&iota;&#x1F71;&rho;&alpha;</span> of the Greeks, and <i>tiara</i>
  of the Latins, expresses the cloth cap or <i>fez</i> of the Parthians,
  Persians, Armenians, &amp;c., <!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page145"></a>{145}</span>which was a low scull-cap amongst the
  commonalty, but a stiff and elevated covering for the kings and
  personages of distinction (Xen. <i>Anab.</i> ii. 5, 23.). This imposing
  tiara is frequently represented on ancient monuments, where it varies in
  some details, though always preserving the characteristic peculiarity of
  a tall upright head-dress. It is sometimes truncated at its upper
  extremity, at others a genuine round-topped bonnet, like the Phrygian cap
  when pulled out to its full length, and stiffened so as to stand
  erect&mdash;each a variety of form peculiar to certain classes or degrees
  of rank, which at this period we are not able to decide and distinguish
  with certainty. But on a bas-relief from Persepolis, supposed to have
  belonged to the palace of Cyrus, and engraved by Ferrario (<i>Costume
  dell' Asia</i>, vol. iii. tav. 47.), may be seen a bonnet shaped very
  much like a beehive, the exact type of the papal tiara, with three bands
  (the <i>triregno</i>) round its sides, and only wanting the cross at the
  summit, and the strawberry-leaved decoration, to distinguish it from the
  one worn by Pio Nono: and on a medal of Augustus, engraved on a larger
  scale in Rich's <i>Companion to the Latin Dictionary</i>, art. Tutulus,
  we find this identical form, with an unknown ornament of the top, for
  which the popes substituted a cross, reappearing on the skull of a pagan
  priest. I may add that the upright tiaras represented on works of ancient
  art, which can be proved, or are known to be worn by royal personages,
  are truncated at the summit; whence it does not seem an improper
  inference to conclude that the round and conical ones belonged to persons
  inferior to the kings alone in rank and influence, the Magi; which is the
  more probable, since it is clear that they were adopted by the highest
  priests of two other religions, those of Pagan and of Christian Rome.</p>

  <p>If space admits, I would also add that the official insignia and
  costume of a cardinal are likewise derived from the pagan usages of
  Greece. Amongst his co-religionists he is supposed to symbolize one of
  the Apostles of Christ, who went forth ill clothed and coarsely shod to
  preach the Gospel; whereas, in truth, his comfortable hat, warm cloak,
  and showy stockings, are but borrowed plumage from the ordinary
  travelling costume of a Greek <i>messenger</i> (<span title="apostolos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&pi;&omicron;&sigma;&tau;&#x1F79;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>).
  The sentiment of travelling is always conveyed in the ancient bas-reliefs
  and vase paintings by certain conventional signs or accessories bestowed
  upon the figure represented, viz., a broad-brimmed and low-crowned hat
  (<span title="petasos" class="grk"

<h3>DRYDEN'S ESSAY UPON SATIRE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., pp. 422. 462.)</p>

  <p>The Query proposed by your correspondent, as to the authorship of the
  <i>Essay on Satire</i>, is a very interesting one, and I am rather
  surprised that it has not yet been replied to. In favour of your
  correspondent's view, and I think it is perhaps the strongest argument
  which can be alleged, is Dean Lockier's remark:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Could anything be more impudent than his (Sheffield's) publishing
  that satire, for writing which Dryden was beaten in Rose Alley (and which
  was so remarkably known by the name of the 'Rose Alley Satire') as his
  own? Indeed he made a few alterations in it, but these were only verbal,
  and generally for the worse."&mdash;Spence's <i>Anecdotes</i>, edit.
  Singer, p. 64.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Dean Lockier, it must be observed, was well acquainted with Dryden
  from 1685 to the time of his death; and appears to speak so positively
  that he would seem to have acquired his knowledge from Dryden's own
  information. His first introduction to that great poet arose from an
  observation made in Dryden's hearing about his Mac Fleckno; and it is
  therefore the more likely that he would be correctly informed as to the
  author's other satires. Dean Lockier was, it may be added, a good critic;
  and his opinions on literary subjects are so just, that it is to be
  regretted we have only very few of them.</p>

  <p>I confess I do not attach much weight to the argument arising from the
  lines on the Earl of Mulgrave himself contained in the poem. To transfer
  suspicion from himself, in so general a satire, it was necessary to
  include his own name amongst the rest; but, though the lines are somewhat
  obscure, it is, after all, as respects him, compared with the other
  persons mentioned, a very gentle flagellation, and something like what
  children call a make-believe. Indeed Rochester, in a letter to his friend
  Henry Saville (21st Nov. 1679), speaks of it as a panegyric.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Mulgrave expressly denied Dryden's being the
  author, in the lines in his <i>Essay on Poetry</i>,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Tho' praised and punished for another's rhymes."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>and by inference claimed the poem, or at least the lines on Rochester,
  as his own. Dryden, in the Preface to his Virgil, praises the <i>Essay on
  Poetry</i> in the highest terms; but says not a word to dispute
  Mulgrave's statement, though he might then have safely claimed the
  <i>Essay on Satire</i>, if his own; and though he must have been aware
  that, by his silence, he was virtually resigning his sole claim to its
  authorship. It was subsequently included in Mulgrave's works, and has
  ever since gone under the joint names of himself and Dryden.</p>

  <p>On the question of internal evidence critics differ. Your
  correspondent can see in it no hand but Dryden's; while Malone will
  scarcely allow that Dryden made even a few verbal alterations in it
  (Life, p. 130.); and Sir Walter Scott is not inclined to admit any
  further participation on the part of the great poet than "a few hints for
  revision," and denies its merit altogether&mdash;a position in which I
  think very few, who carefully peruse it, will agree with him.</p>

  <p>I am disposed to take a middle course between your correspondent and
  Dryden's two biographers, and submit that there is quite sufficient
  internal evidence of joint ownership. I cannot think such lines
  as&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"I, who so wise and humble seem to be,</p>
      <p>Now my own vanity and pride can't see;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>or,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"I, who have all this while been finding fault,</p>
      <p>E'en with my master who first satire taught,</p>
      <p>And did by that describe the task so hard,</p>
      <p>It seems stupendious, and above reward."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>or,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"To tell men freely of their foulest faults,</p>
      <p>To laugh at their vain deeds and vainer thoughts:"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>would proceed from Dryden, while it is to be noticed that the
  inharmonious rhymes "faults" and "thoughts" were favourites of Mulgrave,
  and occur twice in his <i>Essay on Poetry</i>.</p>

  <p>Neither can I doubt that the verses on Shaftesbury,&mdash;the four
  "will any dog;" the four "For words and wit did anciently agree," the
  four "Mean in each action;" the two "Each pleasure has its
  price"&mdash;are Dryden's additions, with many others, which a careful
  reader will instantly appropriate.</p>

  <p>I can find no sufficient authority for the statement of Malone and Sir
  W. Scott, that Pope revised the <i>Essay on Satire</i>. It is well known
  he corrected that on Poetry.</p>

<h3>FOUNDATION-STONE OF ST. MARK'S AT VENICE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 88.)</p>

  <p>I recollect having seen the stone in question in the collection of the
  late Mr. Douce, in whose possession it had been for some years before his
  communication of it to the Society of Antiquaries. It is quite evident
  that he was satisfied of its authenticity, and it was most probably an
  accidental purchase from some dealer in antiquities, who knew nothing
  about it. I happen to know that it remained in the hands of Sir Henry
  Ellis at the time of Mr. Douce's death, and your correspondent H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;R.
  will most probably find it among the other collections of Mr. Douce now
  in the museum at Goodrich Castle.</p>

  <p>The doubt expressed by your correspondent is evidently founded upon
  the engraving and accompanying paper in the 26th volume of the
  <i>Archæologia</i>; and as it conveys such a grave censure of the
  judgment of the director of the council and secretaries of the
  Antiquarian Society, it appears to me that it is incumbent upon him to
  satisfy his doubts by seeing the stone itself, and, if he should be
  convinced of his error, to make the <i>amende honorable</i>.</p>

  <p>It is to be regretted that he did not state "the points which have
  suggested this notion of its being a hoax." For my own part, I cannot see
  the motive for such a falsification; and if it is one, it is the
  contrivance of some one who had more epigraphic skill than is usually
  found on such occasions.</p>

  <p>There is nothing in the objection of your correspondent as to the size
  and form of the stone which would have any weight, and it is not
  necessary to suppose that it "must have been loose in the world for 858
  years." On pulling down the old church, the foundation-stone in which
  this was imbedded may have been buried with the rubbish, and exhumed in
  comparatively recent times. It had evidently fallen into rude and
  ignorant hands, and suffered by being violently detached from the stone
  in which it was imbedded.</p>

  <p>Every one who knew the late Mr. Douce must have full confidence in his
  intimate knowledge of mediæval antiquity, and would not easily be led to
  imagine that he could be deceived on a point like this; but are we to
  presume, from a vague <i>idea</i> of your correspondent's, that the
  executive body of the Society of Antiquaries would fail to detect a
  forgery of this nature?</p>

  <p class="author">S. W. S., <i>olim</i> F. S. A.

  <p><i>Foundation-stone of St. Mark's, Venice</i> (Vol. iii.,
  p.88.).&mdash;This singular relic is now preserved in the "Doucean
  Museum," at Goodrich Court, Herefordshire, with the numerous objects of
  art and antiquities bequeathed by Mr. Douce to the late Sir Samuel
  Meyrick. I believe that nothing can now be ascertained regarding the
  history of this stone, or how it came into the possession of Mr. Douce.
  Sir Samuel enumerates it amongst "Miscellaneous Antiquities," No. 2., in
  his interesting Inventory of this Collection, given in the <i>Gentleman's
  Magazine</i>, Feb., 1835, p. 198. The Doucean Museum comprises, probably,
  the finest series of specimens of sculpture in ivory existing in any
  collection in England. The Limoges enamels are also highly deserving of
  notice.</p>

<h3>HISTOIRE DES SÉVARAMBES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., pp. 4. and 72.)</p>

  <p>I am not sufficiently familiar with Vossius or his works to form any
  opinion as to the accuracy of the conclusion which <span class="sc">Mr.
  Crossley</span> has arrived at. There is at least much obscurity in the
  matter, to which I have long paid some little attention.</p>

  <p>My Copy is entitled,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The History of the Sevarambians: A People of the South continent. In
  <i>Five</i> Parts. Containing an Account of the Government, &amp;c.
  Translated from the Memoirs of Capt. <i>Siden</i>, who lived fifteen
  years amongst them. Lond. 1738." (8vo. pp. xxiii. and 412.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have given this to show how it differs from that spoken of by <span
  class="sc">Mr. C.</span> as being in <i>two</i> parts, by Capt. Thos.
  <i>L</i>iden, and not a reprint, but a translation from the French, which
  Lowndes says was "considerably <i>altered</i> and <i>enlarged</i>."</p>

  <p>If this be so, we can hardly ascribe to Vossius the edition of 1738.
  The preface intimates that the papers were written in Latin, French,
  Italian, and Dutch, and placed in the editor's hands in England, on his
  promising to methodise them and put them all into one language; but I do
  not observe the slightest allusion to the work having previously appeared
  either in English or French, although we find that Barbier, in his
  <i>Dict. des Anon.</i>, gives the French edit. 1 pt. Paris, 1677; 2 pt.
  Paris, 1678 et 1679, 2 vols. 12mo.; Nouvelle edit. Amsterdam, 1716, 2
  vols. 12mo.; and ascribes it to Denis Vairasse d'Alais.</p>

  <p>There is a long account of this work in <i>Dict. Historique</i>, par
  Marchand: à la Haye, 1758, fo. sub. nom., Allais, as the author,
  observing&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Il y a diversité d'opinions touchant la langue en laquelle il a été
  écrit ou composé."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The earliest he mentions is the English one of 1675, and an edition in
  the French, "à Paris, 1677;" which states on the title, <i>Traduit de
  l'Anglois</i>, whereas the second part is "imprimée à Paris <i>chez
  l'Auteur</i>, 1678," from which Marchand concludes that Allais was the
  writer, adding,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On n'a peut-être jamais vu de Fiction composée avec plus d'art et
  plus d'industrie, et il faut avouer <!-- Page 148 --><span

  vraisemblable soit aussi ingénieusement et aussi adroitement

</blockquote>

  <p>Wm. Taylor, of Norwich, writes to Southey, asking,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Can you tell me who wrote the <i>History of the Sevarambians</i>? The
  book is to me curious. Wieland steals from it so often, that it must have
  been a favourite in his library; if I had to impute the book by guess, I
  would fix on Maurice Ashby, the translator of Xenophon's
  <i>Cyropædia</i>, as the author."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>to which Southey replies,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Of the Sevarambians I know nothing!" (See <i>Gent. Mag.</i> N.S. xxi.
  p. 355.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Sir W. Scott, in his <i>Memoirs of Swift</i>, p. 304. (edit. 1834),
  speaking of <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>, says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A third volume was published by an unblushing forger, as early as
  1727, without printer's name, a great part of which is unacknowledged
  plunder from a work entitled <i>Hist. des Sévarambes</i>, ascribed to
  Mons. Alletz, suppressed in France and other Catholic kingdoms on account
  of its deistical opinions."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It would seem from this, that Sir Walter was not aware of the English
  work, or knew much of its origin or the author.</p>

  <p class="author">F. R. A.

  <p><i>Histoire des Sévarambes.</i>&mdash;The second edition of Gulliver's
  Travels, entitled <i>Travels into several Remote Nations of the World, by
  Lemuel Gulliver</i>, 2 vols. 8vo., London, 1727, is accompanied with a
  spurious third volume, printed at London in the same year, with a similar
  title-page, but not professing to be a second edition. This third volume
  is divided into two parts: the first part consists, first, of an
  Introduction in pp. 20; next, of two chapters, containing a second voyage
  to Brobdingnag, which are followed by four chapters, containing a voyage
  to Sporunda. The second part consists of six chapters, containing a
  voyage to Sevarambia, a voyage to Monatamia, a voyage to Batavia, a
  voyage to the Cape, and a voyage to England. The whole of the third
  volume, with the exception of the introduction and the two chapters
  relating to Brobdingnag, is derived from the <i>Histoire des

<h3>TOUCHING FOR THE EVIL.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., pp. 42. 93.)</p>

  <p>There is ample evidence that the French monarchs performed the
  ceremony of touching for the evil.</p>

  <p>In a MS. in the University Library, Cambridge<a name="footnotetag18"
  href="#footnote18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>, is this memorandum:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Kings of England and <i>Fraunce</i> by a peculiar guift cure the
  King's evill by touching them with their handes, and so doth the seaventh
  sonne."&mdash;<i>Ant. Miraldus</i>, p. 384.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Fuller intimates that St. Louis was the first king of France who
  healed the evil. "So witnesseth Andrew Chasne, a French author, and
  others."<a name="footnotetag19"
  href="#footnote19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Speaking of the illness of Louis XI., "at Forges neere to Chinon," in
  March, 1480, Philip de Commines says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"After two daies he recovered his speech and his memory after a sort:
  and because he thought no man understood him so wel as my selfe, his
  pleasure was that I should alwaies be by him, and he confessed himselfe
  to the officiall in my presence, otherwise they would never have
  understood one another. He had not much to say, for he was shriven not
  long before, because the Kings of Fraunce use alwaies to confesse
  themselves when they touch those that be sick of the King's evill, which
  he never failed to do once a weeke. If other Princes do not the like,
  they are to blame, for continuall a great number are troubled with that
  disease."<a name="footnotetag20"
  href="#footnote20"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Pierre Desrey, in his <i>Great Chronicles of Charles VIII.</i>, has
  the following passage relating to that monarch's proceedings at Rome in
  January, 1494-5:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Tuesday the 20th, the king heard mass in the French chapel, and
  afterwards touched and cured many afflicted with the king's evil, to the
  great astonishment of the Italians who witnessed the miracle."<a
  name="footnotetag21" href="#footnote21"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And speaking of the king at Naples, in April, 1495, the same
  chronicler says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The 15th of April, the king, after hearing mass in the church of the
  Annonciada, was confessed, and then touched and cured great numbers that
  were afflicted with the evil&mdash;a disorder that abounded much all over
  Italy&mdash;when the spectators were greatly edified at the powers of
  such an extraordinary gift.</p>

  <p>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

  <p>"On Easter day, the 19th of April, the king was confessed in the

  <p>Fuller, in remarking upon the cure of the king's evil by the touch of
  our English monarchs, observes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The kings of France share also with those of England in this

  href="#footnote23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Cavendish, relating what took place on Cardinal Wolsey's embassy to
  Francis I., in 1527, has the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And at his [the king's] coming in to the bishop's palace [at Amiens],
  where he intended to dine with my Lord Cardinal, there sat within a
  cloister about two hundred persons diseased with the king's evil, upon
  their knees. And the king, or ever he went to dinner, provised every of
  them with rubbing them and blessing them with his bare hands, being
  bareheaded all the while; after whom followed his almoner distributing of
  money unto the persons diseased. And that done, he said certain prayers
  over them, and then washed his hands, and so came up into his chamber to
  dinner, where as my lord dined with him."<a name="footnotetag24"
  href="#footnote24"><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Laurentius, cited by Fuller in the page already given, was, it seems,
  physician in ordinary to King Henry IV. of France. In a treatise entitled
  <i>De Mirabili Strumarum Curatione</i>, he stated that the kings of
  England never cured the evil. "To cry quits with him," Dr. W. Tucker,
  chaplain to Queen Elizabeth, in his <i>Charismate</i>, denied that the
  kings of France ever originally cured the evil</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Louis XVI., immediately after his coronation at Rheims, in 1775, went
  to the Abbey of St. Remi to pay his devotions, and to touch for the evil.
  The ceremony took place in the Abbey Park, and is thus described in a
  paper entitled <i>Coronation of the Kings of France prior to the
  Revolution</i>, by Charles White, Esq.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Two thousand four hundred individuals suffering under this
  affliction, having been assembled in rows in the park, his majesty,
  attended by the household physicians, approached the first on the right.
  The physician-in-chief then placed his hand upon the patient's head,
  whilst a captain of the guards held the hands of the latter joined before
  his bosom. The king, with his head uncovered, then touched the patient by
  making the sign of the cross upon his face, exclaiming, 'May God heal
  thee! The king touches thee.' The whole two thousand four hundred having
  been healed in a similar manner, and the grand almoner having distributed
  alms to each in succession, three attendants, called <i>chefs de
  goblet</i>, presented themselves with golden salvers, on which were three
  embroidered napkins. The first, steeped in vinegar, was then offered to
  the king by Monsieur; the second, dipped in plain water, was presented by
  the Count d'Artois; and the third, moistened with orange water, was
  banded by the Duke of Orleans."<a name="footnotetag26"

  <p>The power of the seventh son to heal the evil (mentioned in the MS. I

  subjoin the passage, which occurs in a letter signed "D. Distaff."</p>

  <p><i>Obeism.</i>&mdash;As your correspondent T. H. (Vol. iii., p. 59.)
  desires "any information" on the subject of <i>Obeism</i>, in the absence
  of more and better, I offer my mite: that in the early part of this
  century it was very common among the slave-population in the West Indies,
  especially on the remoter estates&mdash;of course of African
  origin&mdash;not as either a "religion" or a "rite," but rather as a
  superstition; a power claimed by its professors, and assented to by the
  <i>patients</i>, of causing good or evil to, or averting it from them;
  which was of course always for a "consideration" of some sort, to the
  profit, whether honorary, pecuniary, or other, of the dispenser. It is by
  the pretended influence of certain spells, charms, ceremonies, amulets
  worn, or other such incantations, as practised with more or less
  diversity by the adepts, the magicians and conjurers, the "false
  prophets" of all ages and countries.</p>

<p><!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150"></a>{150}</span></p>

  <p>On this matter, a curious phenomenon to investigate would be, the
  process by which the untonsured neophyte is converted into the bonneted
  doctor; the progress and stages of his mind in the different phases of
  the practice; how he begins by deceiving himself, to end in deceiving
  others; the first uninquiring ignorance; the gradual admission of ideas,
  what he is taught or left to imagine; the faith, of what is fancied to be
  so, the mechanical belief; then the confusion of thought from the
  intrusion of doubt and uncertainty; the adoption of some undefined
  notions; and, finally, actual unbelief; followed by designed and
  systematic injustice in the practice of what first was taken up in
  sincerity, though even this now perhaps is not unmixed with some fancy of
  its reality. For this must be the gradation more or less gone through in
  all such things, whether Obeism, Fetichism, the Evil Eye, or any sort of
  sorcery or witchcraft, in whatever variousness of form practised; cheats
  on the one hand, and dupes on the other the <i>primum mobile</i> in every
  case being, some shape or other of <i>gain</i> to the practitioner.</p>

  <p>It seems, however, hardly likely that Obeism should now be "rapidly
  gaining ground again" there, from the greater spread of Christianity and
  diffusion of enlightenment and information in general since the
  slave-emancipation; as also from the absence of its feeding that formerly
  accompanied every fresh importation from the coast: as, like mists before
  the mounting sun, all such impostures must fade away before common sense,
  truth, and facts, whenever these are allowed their free influence.</p>

  <p>The conclusion, then, would rather be, that Obeism is on the decline
  only more apparent, when now seen, than formerly, from its attracting
  greater notice.</p>

  <p><i>Obeahism.</i>&mdash;In answer to T. H.'s Query regarding Obeahism,
  though I cannot answer his question fully, as to its origin, &amp;c., yet
  I have thought that what I can communicate may serve to piece out the
  more valuable information of your better informed correspondents. I was
  for a short time in the island of Jamaica, and from what I could learn
  there of Obeahism, the power seemed to be obtained by the Obeah-man or
  woman, by working upon the fears of their fellow-negroes, who are
  notoriously superstitious. The principal charm seemed to be, a collection
  of feathers, coffin furniture, and one or two other things which I have
  forgotten. A small bundle of this, hung over the victim's door, or placed
  in his path, is supposed to have the power of bringing ill luck to the
  unfortunate individual. And if any accident, or loss, or sickness should
  happen to him about the time, it is immediately imputed to the dreaded
  influence of Obeah! But I have heard of cases where the unfortunate
  victim has gradually wasted away, and died under this powerful spell,
  which, I have been informed by old residents in the island, is to be
  attributed to a more natural cause, namely, the influence of poison. The
  Obeah-man causes a quantity of <i>ground glass</i> to be mixed with the
  food of the person who has incurred his displeasure; and the result is
  said to be a slow but sure and wasting death! Perhaps some of your
  medical readers can say whether an infusion of <i>powdered glass</i>
  would have this effect. I merely relate what I have been told by
  others.</p>

  <p>While speaking of the superstition of the negroes, I may mention a
  very curious one, very generally received and universally believed among
  them, called the <i>rolling calf</i>, which, if you wish, I will give you
  an account of in my next.</p>

  <p><i>Pillgarlick</i> (Vol. ii., p. 393.; Vol. iii., pp. 42.
  74.).&mdash;It seems to me that the passage quoted from Skelton by
  F.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Q. completely elucidates the meaning of this word. Let us premise
  that, according to all principles of English etymology,
  <i>pill-garlick</i> is as likely to mean "the pillar of garlick" as to be
  a syncopated form of "<i>pill'd garlick</i>." Now we see from Skelton's
  verse that in his time the peeling of garlick was proverbially a degraded
  employment&mdash;one which was probably thrust off upon the lowest inmate
  of the servants' hall, in an age when garlick entered largely into the
  composition of all made dishes. The disagreeable nature of the occupation
  is sufficient to account for this. Accordingly we may well suppose that
  the epithet "a poor pill-garlick" would be applied to any person, in
  miserable circumstances, who might be ready to undertake mean employment
  for a trifling gratuity.</p>

  <p>This, I think, satisfactorily answers the original question, "Whence
  comes the expression?" The verse quoted by F.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Q. satisfactorily
  establishes the orthography, viz., pi<i>ll</i> garlick. A Query of some
  interest still remains&mdash;In what author do we first find the compound
  word?</p>

  <p class="author">R. D. H.

  <p><i>Pillgarlick</i> (Vol. iii., p. 74.).&mdash;That <i>to pill</i> is
  merely another form of the word <i>to peel</i>, appears from the book of
  Genesis, c. xxx., v. 37, 38: "And Jacob took him rods of green poplar,
  and of the hazel and chesnut tree: and <i>pilled</i> white strakes in
  them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. And he set the
  rods which he had <i>pilled</i> before the flocks," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>On first seeing your correspondent's Query, it occurred to me that
  perhaps "poor Pillgarlick" was in some way akin to "Pillicock," of whom
  Edgar, in <i>King Lear</i>, records that "Pillicock sat on Pillicock's
  hill;" but the connexion between these two worthies, if any, I confess
  myself quite unable to trace.</p>

  <p>I conceive that Pillgarlick means "peeler of garlick," <i>i.e.</i>
  scullion; or, to borrow a phrase from a witness in a late case at the
  Middlesex sessions, <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page151"></a>{151}</span>which has attracted some attention, "a
  person in a low way of life."</p>

  <p>The passage from Skelton, cited by your correspondent F.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Q., may, I
  think, be explained thus: the will is so powerful in man's moral
  constitution, that the reason must content itself with an inferior place
  (as that of a scullion compared with that of the master of the house); or
  if it attempts to assert its proper place, it will find it a hopeless
  endeavour&mdash;as hopeless as that of "rosting a stone."</p>

  <i>Hornbook</i> in the British Museum, which I have this morning
  examined.</p>

  <p>It is marked in the new catalogue (Press Mark 828, a. 55.). It
  contains on one side the "Old English Alphabet"&mdash;the capitals in two
  lines, the small letters in one. The fourth line contains the vowels
  twice repeated (perhaps to <i>doubly</i> impress upon the pupil the
  necessity of learning them). Next follow, in two columns, our ancient
  companions, "ab, eb, ib," &amp;c., and "ba, be, bi," &amp;c. After the
  formula of exorcism comes the "Lord's Prayer" (which is given somewhat
  differently to our present version), winding up with "i. ii. iii. iiii.
  v. vi. vii. viii. ix. x." On the other side is the following whimsical
  piece of composition:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><i>"What more could be wished for, even by a literary gourmand under

  <p><i>Bacon</i> (Vol. iii., p. 41.).&mdash;The explanation given in a
  former number from old Verstegan, of the original meaning of the family
  name of Bacon, and the application of the word to the unclean beast, with
  the corroboration from the pages of Collins's <i>Baronetage</i>, is very
  interesting. The word, as applied to the salted flesh of the <i>dead</i>
  animal, is another instance of the introduction of a foreign term for a
  <i>dead</i> animal, in opposition to the Anglo-Saxon name of the living
  animal. It was used in this sense in France at a very early period; and
  Ampère, in his <i>Histoire Littéraire de la France avant le 12ième
  Siècle</i>, iii. 482., mentions the word among other instances of
  Gallicisms in the Latin of the Carolingian diplomas and capitularies, and
  quotes the capitularies of Charles the Fat. <i>Bacco, porc salé,</i> from
  the <i>vulgar</i> word <i>bacon</i>, <i>jambon</i>. The word was in use
  as late as the seventeenth century in Dauphiné, and the bordering cantons
  of Switzerland, and is cited in the <i>Moyen de Parvenir</i>, ch. 38. The
  passage is curious, as it would seem to intimate that Lord Bacon was one
  of the personages introduced in that very extraordinary production of the
  Rabelaisian school.</p>

  <p>I have frequently heard the word employed by the country people in the
  markets of Geneva.</p>

  <i>Wayfaring Sketches among the Greeks and Turks</i>. 2d edit.

  &amp;c., <i>the mark left by the pressure of two fingers of a small hand
  was distinctly visible</i> (?)."</p>

  <p><i>Meaning of Cefn.</i>&mdash;What is the meaning of the Welsh word
  "Cefn" used as prefix?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Josephus.</span>

  <p>1. The first meaning of the word "Cefn" is, "the back;" <i>e.g.</i>
  "Cefn dyn," "the back of a man."</p>

  <p>2. It also signifies "the upper part of the ridge of some elevated and
  exposed land." As a prefix, its meaning depends upon the fact whether the
  word attached to it be an adjective or a substantive. If an adjective be
  attached, it has the <i>second</i> signification; <i>i.e.</i> it is the
  upper part of some exposed land, having the particular quality involved
  in the adjective, such as, "Cefndu," "Cefngwyn," "Cefncoch," the black,
  white, or red headland.</p>

  <p>When a substantive is attached, it has the <i>first</i> signification;
  <i>i.e.</i> it is the <i>back</i> of the thing signified by the
  substantive; such as, "Cefnllys," the back of the court.</p>

  <p><i>Sir Alexander Cumming</i> (Vol. iii., p. 39.).&mdash;In answer to
  an inquiry relative to Sir Alexander Cumming, of Culter, I may refer to
  the <i>Scottish Journal</i> (Menzies, Edin. 1848) <i>of Topography,
  Antiquities, Traditions, &amp;c.</i>, vol. ii. p. 254., where an extract
  from a MS. autobiography of the baronet is given. The work in which this
  occurs is little known; but, as a repertory of much curious and
  interesting information, deserved a more extensive circulation than it
  obtained. It stopped with the second volume, and is now somewhat scarce,
  as the unsold copies were disposed of for waste paper.</p>

  <p><i>Pater-noster Tackling</i> (Vol. iii., p.
  89.).&mdash;<i>Pater-noster fishing-tackle</i>, so called in the shops,
  is used to catch fish (perch, for instance) which take the bait at
  various distances between the surface and the bottom of the water.
  Accordingly, hooks are attached to a line at given intervals throughout
  its length, with leaden shots, likewise regularly distributed, in order
  to sink it, and keep it extended perpendicularly in the water.</p>

  <p>This regularity of arrangement, and the resemblance of the shots to
  <i>beads</i>, seems to have caused the contrivance to have been, somewhat
  fancifully, likened to a <i>chaplet</i> or <i>rosary</i>. In a rosary
  there is a bead longer than the rest, for distinction's sake called the
  <i>Pater-noster</i>; from whence that name applies to a rosary; and,
  therefore, to anything likened to it; and, therefore, to the article of
  <i>fishing-tackle</i> in question.</p>

  <p>The word <i>pater-noster</i>, i.e. <i>pater-noster-wise</i>, is an
  heraldic term (<i>vide</i> Ash's <i>Dictionary</i>), applied to
  <i>beads</i> disposed in the form of a cross.</p>

  <p><i>Venville</i> (Vol. iii., p. 38.).&mdash;R. E. G. inquires
  respecting the origin of this word, as applied to certain tenants round
  Dartmoor Forest. The name is peculiar to that district, and is applied
  chiefly to certain <i>vills</i> or villages (for the most part also
  parishes), and to certain tenements within them, which pay fines to the
  Lord of Lidford and Dartmoor, viz. the Prince of Wales, as Duke of
  Cornwall. The fines are supposed to be due in respect either of rights of
  common on the forest, or of trespasses committed by cattle on it; for the
  point is a <i>vexata quæstio</i> between the lord and tenants of Dartmoor
  and the tenants of the Venville lands, which lie along the boundaries of
  it. <!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page153"></a>{153}</span>In the accounts rendered to the lord of
  these fines, there was a distinct title, headed <i>"Fines Villarum"</i>
  when these accounts were in Latin; and I think it cannot be doubted that
  the lands and tenures under this title came to be currently called
  <i>Finevill</i> lands from this circumstance. Hence Fenvill, Fengfield,
  or Venvill; the last being now the usual spelling and pronunciation.

  <p><i>Shakspeare's Use of the Word "Captious"</i> (Vol. ii., p.
  354.).&mdash;Why may not the word have the same meaning as it has now? A
  <i>captious</i> person is not primarily a deceitful person, but either
  one who catches at any argument to uphold his own cause, or, more
  generally, one who catches or cavils at arguments or expressions used by
  another, and fastens a frivolous objection on them; one who takes
  exception to a point on paltry and insufficient grounds:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Yet in this captious and intenible sieve</p>
      <p>I still pour in the waters of my love."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><i>i.e.</i> yet into this sieve, which catches at, and yet never holds
  them, I still pour the waters of my love.</p>

  <p>There seems to me a double meaning of the word <i>captious</i>,
  indicating an under-current of thought in the author; first, the literal
  sense, then the inferential: "this sieve catches at and seems as if it
  would intercept the waters of my love, but takes me in, and disappoints
  me, because it will not uphold them." The objection to explaining
  <i>captious</i> by simply <i>fallacious</i>, is that the word means this
  by inference or consequence, rather than primarily. Because one who is
  eager to controvert, <i>i.e.</i> who is captious, generally, but not
  always, acts for a sophistical purpose and means to deceive. Cicero, I
  believe, uses <i>fallax</i> and <i>captiosus</i> as distinct, not as

  Query which he has undertaken to answer touching the custom of ringing a

  add more solemnity to the occasion."</p>

  <p>The custom is <i>invariably</i> observed throughout Italy, and is
  common in France and Spain. I have witnessed at least some hundreds of
  funerals in various cities and villages of Piedmont, Sardinia, Tuscany,
  the Roman States, Naples, Elba, and Sicily; and in Malta; yet never knew
  I one without the handbell.</p>

  <p>Its <i>object</i>, as first explained to me in Florence, is to clear

  off their hats; and to call the pious to their doors and windows to gaze
  upon the emblems of mortality, and to say a prayer for the repose of the
  departed soul.</p>

  <p>How different were the effusions of Waller's earlier muse! In the year
  1645, Humphrey Mosley published "<i>Poems, &amp;c</i>., written by Mr.

  <p>It is not a little remarkable that the same publisher, in the same
  year, should have also given to the world the first edition of that
  precious volume&mdash;Milton's <i>Minor Poems</i>; and, in the
  advertisement prefixed, he thus adverts to the circumstance:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  author the annual gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society; and that
  it is a book adapted to the exigencies of astronomers of all degrees,
  from the experienced astronomer, furnished with every modern refinement
  of appliances and means of observation, to the humbler, but perhaps no
  less zealous beginner, furnished only with a good pair of natural eyes,
  aided, on occasion, by the common opera-glass. Such an observer, if he
  goes the right way to work, will make sure of a high degree of

  <p><i>Simon Bache</i> (Vol. iii., p. 105.).&mdash;<i>Thesaurarius

  Chauncy's <i>Hertfordshire</i>, vol. ii. p. 102., the inscription on
  Simon Bache is given in the same terms as by your correspondent. The
  learned author then gives, at p. 103., the epitaph on another monument
  also in Knebworth Church, erected to the memory of John Hotoft, in which
  occur these two lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Hospitii regis qui Thesaurarius olim</p>
      <p>Henrici sexti merito pollebat honore."</p>

  <p>At p. 93. of the same volume, Sir Henry Chauncy speaks of the same
  John Hotoft as an eminent man, and sheriff of the county, and adds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He was also Treasurer of the King's Household afterwards; he dyed and
  was buried in the chancel of this church, where his monument remains at
  this day."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Who Simon Bache was, or how he came to be buried at Knebworth, I
  cannot tell. The name of "Bach" occurs in Chauncy several times, as that
  of mayors and assistants, at Hertford, between 1672 and 1689.</p>

  the late Colonel John Gilbert-Cooper-Gardiner. The song of "Winifreda" is
  at page 282. of the 4th volume; and a manuscript note, in the handwriting
  of the son of the author of <i>Letters concerning Taste</i>, states it to
  have been written "by John Gilbert Cooper." The <i>praise</i> bestowed by
  Cooper on the poem, and which J.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;M. conceives to militate against his
  claim to the composition, is obviously intended to apply to the
  <i>original</i>, and not to Cooper's elegant translation.</p>

  <p><i>Queries on Costume</i> (Vol. iii., p. 88.).&mdash;Addison's paper

  class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>{156}</span>conclusive that hooped
  petticoats were not in use so early as the year 1651. The anecdote in
  connection with the subject related in Wilson's <i>Life of De Foe</i>,
  has always appeared to me very questionable, not only on that
  consideration, but because Charles was at the time a fine tall young man
  of more than twenty-one years of age, and at the only period that he
  could have been in the neighbourhood referred to, he was on horseback and
  attended by at least two persons, who were also mounted. Neither can the
  circumstances related be at all reconciled with the particulars given by
  Clarendon and subsequent writers, who have professed to correct the
  statements of that historian by authority.</p>

  <p><i>Antiquitas Sæculi Juventus Mundi</i> (Vol. ii., p. 218.; Vol. iii.,

  to the eminent authorities cited in your pages, that the comprehensive
  words of Lord Bacon, "Antiquitas sæculi juventus mundi," were not
  borrowed from any author, ancient or modern. But it would be a compliment
  which that great genius would have been the first to ridicule, were we to
  affirm that no anterior writer had adopted analogous language in
  expressing the benefits of "the philosophy of time." On the contrary, he
  would have called our attention to the expressions of the Egyptian priest
  addressed to Solon, (see a few pages beyond the one referred to in his
  <i>Advancement of Learning</i>):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ye Grecians are ever children, ye have no knowledge of antiquity nor

  <p>The words of Bacon to me appear to be a condensation of the well-known

  in the following paraphrase:</p>

  <p><i>Lady Bingham</i> (Vol. iii., p. 61.).&mdash;Lady Bingham, whose
  daughter, afterwards Lady Crewe, was unsuccessfully courted by Sir
  Symonds D'Ewes (for which see his autobiography), was Sarah, the daughter
  of John Heigham, Esq., of Gifford's Hall in Urekham Brook, Suffolk, of
  the same family with Sir Clement Heigham, Knt., of Barrow, Suffolk,
  Speaker of the House of Commons. She was married by banns at St. Olave's,
  Hart Street, Jan. 11, 1588, to Sir Richard Bingham, Knt., of co. Dorset.
  She married, secondly, Edward Waldegrave, Esq., of Lawford, Essex, to
  whom she was second wife, and by him had Jemima, afterwards Lady Crewe.
  Edward Waldegrave, married to his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of
  Bartholomew Averell, of Southminster, Essex, had by her an only daughter,
  Anne, who married Drew, afterwards Sir Drew Drury, Bart., of
  Riddlesworth, Norfolk. He, Edward Waldegrave, was descended from a
  younger branch of the family of Waldegrave, of Smallbridge, in the parish
  of Bures, Suffolk, from whence descends the present Earl Waldegrave.</p>

  <p>Lady Bingham lies buried in the chancel of Lawford church, where a
  stone in the floor states her age to have been sixty-nine, and that she
  was buried Sept. 9. 1634. There is also another stone in the floor for
  Edward Waldegrave, Esq., who married Dame Sarah Bingham, by whom he had
  one daughter, Jemima, who was married to John Stearne (a mistake
  evidently for Stene, the seat of James Lord Crewe). Edward Waldegrave was
  buried Feb. 13, 1621, aged about sixty-eight.</p>

  <p>The large monument in Lawford church is for the father of this Edward
  Waldegrave, who died in 1584.</p>

  <p><i>Proclamation of Langholme Fair</i> (Vol. iii., p. 56.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Monkbarns</span> wishes the meaning of the choice expressions
  in the proclamation. They may be explained as
  follows:&mdash;<i>Hustrin</i>, hustling, or riotously inclined, being so
  consonanted to make it alliterate with <i>custrin</i>, spelt by Jamieson,
  <i>custroun</i>, and signifying a pitiful fellow. Chaucer has the word
  <i>truston</i> in this sense.</p>

  <p><i>Land-louper</i>, one who runs over the country, a vagabond.</p>

  <p><i>Dukes-couper</i> I take to be a petty dealer in ducks or poultry,
  and to be used in a reproachful sense, as we find "pedlar," "jockey,"
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Gang-y-gate swinger</i>, a fighting man, who goes swaggering in the
  road (or <i>gate</i>); a roisterer who takes the wall of every one.
  <i>Swing</i> is an old word for a stroke or blow.</p>

  <p><i>Durdam</i> is an old word meaning an uproar, and akin to the Welsh
  word <i>dowrd</i>. <i>Urdam</i> may be a corruption of <i>whoredom</i>,
  but is more probably prefixed to the genuine word as a co-sounding
  expletive.</p>

  <p><i>Brabblement</i> seems to be a derivative from the Scotch verb
  "bra," to make a loud and disagreeable noise (see Jamieson); and
  <i>squabblement</i> explains itself.</p>

  <p><i>Lugs</i>, ears; <i>tacked</i>, nailed; <i>trone</i>, an old word,
  properly signifying the public weighing-machine, and sometimes used for
  the pillory.</p>

  <p><i>A nail o' twal-a-penny</i> is, of course, a nail of that size and
  sort of which twelve are bought for a penny.</p>

  <p><i>Until he down of his hobshanks, and up with his muckle doubs</i>,
  evidently means, until he goes down on his knees and raises his hands.
  <i>Hobshanks</i> is, I think, still in common use. Of <i>doubs</i> I can
  give no explanation.</p>

  <p>This law appears always to have been received as of authority after

  that constitutional church supremacy vested in our sovereigns, which
  several of our kings before the Reformation had occasion to vindicate
  against Papal claims, and which Henry VIII. strove to carry in the other
  direction, to an unconstitutional excess.</p>

  <p><i>Sir Thomas Herbert's Memoirs</i> (Vol. ii., p. 476.).&mdash;The
  memoirs of Charles I. by Sir Thomas Herbert were published in 1702. I
  transcribe the title from a copy in my possession:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Memoirs of the two last years of the reign of that unparall'd prince,
  of ever blessed memory, king Charles I. By sir Tho. Herbert, major
  Huntingdon, col. Edw. Coke, and Mr. Hen. Firebrace, <i>etc</i>. London,
  Rob. Clavell, 1702, 8vo."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The volume, for a publication of that period, is of uncommon
  occurrence. It was printed, as far as above described, "from a
  <i>manuscript</i> of the Right Reverend the Bishop of Ely, lately
  deceased." The remainder of the volume consists of reprinted
  articles.</p>

  <p><i>Robert Burton</i> (Vol. iii., p. 106.).&mdash;The supposition that
  the author of the <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i> was born at Fald,
  Staffordshire, instead of Lindley, Leicestershire, seems probable from
  the fact, that in an edition of the <i>History of Leicestershire</i>, by
  his brother William, I find that the latter dates his preface "From
  Falde, neere Tutbury, Staff., Oct. 30. 1622." In this work, also, under
  the head "Lindley," is given the pedigree of his family, commencing with
  "James de Burton, Squier of the body to King Richard the First;" down to
  "Rafe Burton, of Lindley, borne 1547; died 17 March, 1619;" leaving
  "Robert Burton, bachelor of divinity and student of Christ Church, Oxon;
  author of the <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>; borne 8 of Febr. 1578;" and
  "William Burton, author of this work (<i>History of Leicestershire</i>),
  borne 24 of Aug. 1575, now dwelling at Falde, ann. 1622."</p>

  <p><i>Drachmarus</i> (Vol. iii., p. 105.).&mdash;If your correspondents
  (Nos. 66 and 67.) who have inquired for a book called <i>Jartuare</i>,
  and for a writer named "Drachmarus," would add a little to the length of
  their questions, so as not by extra-briefness to deaden the dexterity of
  conjecturers, perhaps they might be nearer to the reception of replies.
  Many stranger things have happened than that <i>Drachmarus</i> should be
  renovated by the context into Christian <i>Druthmar</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Averia</i> (Vol. iii., p. 42.).&mdash;I have long desired to know
  the exact meaning of <i>averia</i>, but I have not met with a good
  explanation until lately. It is clear, however, from the following legal
  expression, "<i>Nullus distringatur per averia carucæ.</i>" <i>Caruca</i>
  is the French <i>charrue</i>, and therefore <i>averia</i> must mean
  either cart-horses or oxen which draw the plough.</p>

  <p class="author">P.

  <p><i>Dragons</i> (Vol. iii., p. 40.).&mdash;I think the <i>Draco</i> of
  the Crusaders' times must have been the <i>Boa constrictor</i>. If you
  will look into St. Jerome's <i>Vitas Patrum</i>, you will find that he
  mentions the trail of a "draco" seen in the sand in the Desert, which
  appeared as if a <i>great beam</i> had been dragged along. I think it not
  likely that a crocodile would have <!-- Page 158 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page158"></a>{158}</span>ventured so far from
  the banks of the Nile as to be seen in the Desert.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The members of the Percy Society have just received the third and
  concluding volume of <i>The Canterbury Tales of Geoffrey Chaucer, a new
  Text, with Illustrative Notes, edited by Thomas Wright, Esq</i>. It is
  urged as an objection to Tyrwhitt's excellent edition of the
  <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, that one does not know his authority for any
  particular reading, inasmuch as he has given what he considered the best
  among the different MSS. he consulted. Mr. Wright has gone on an entirely
  different principle. Considering the Harleian MS. (No. 7334.) as both
  "the oldest and best manuscript he has yet met with," he has "reproduced
  it with literal accuracy," and for the adoption of this course Mr. Wright
  may plead the good example of German scholars when editing the
  <i>Nibelungen Lied</i>. That the members of the Society approve the
  principle of giving complete editions of works like the present, has been
  shown by the anxiety with which they have looked for the completion of
  Mr. Wright's labours; and we doubt not that, if the Council follow up
  this edition of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> with some other of the
  collected works which they have announced&mdash;such as those of
  Hoccleve, Taylor the Water Poet, &amp;c.&mdash;they will readily fill up
  any vacancies which may now exist in their list of members.</p>

  <p>Mr. Parker has just issued another handsome, and handsomely
  illustrated volume to gladden the hearts of all ecclesiologists and
  architectural antiquaries. We allude to Mr. Freeman's <i>Essay on the
  Origin and Development of Window Tracery in England</i>, which consists
  of an improved and extended form of several papers on the subject of
  Tracery read before the Oxford Architectural Society at intervals during
  the years 1846 and 1848. To those of our readers who know what are Mr.
  Freeman's abilities for the task he has undertaken, the present
  announcement will be a sufficient inducement to make them turn to the
  volume itself; while those who have not yet paid any attention to this
  interesting chapter in the history of Architectural progress, will find
  no better introduction to the study of it than Mr. Freeman's able volume
  with its four hundred illustrations.</p>

  <p>Mr. Foss has, we hear, gone to press with two additional volumes of
  his <i>Judges of England</i>, which will carry his subject down to the
  end of the reign of Richard III.</p>

  <p><i>The Athenæum</i> of Saturday last announces that the remaining
  Stowe MSS., including the unpublished Diaries and Correspondence of
  George Grenville, have been bought by Mr. Murray, of Albemarle Street,
  from the Trustees of the Duke of Buckingham. The correspondence will form
  about four volumes, and will be ready to appear among our next winter's
  novelties. The Grenville Diary reveals, it is said, the secret movements
  of Lord Bute's administration&mdash;the private histories of Wilkes and
  Lord Chatham&mdash;and the features of the early madness of George III.;
  while the Correspondence exhibits Wilkes, we are told, in a new
  light&mdash;and reveals (what the Stowe Papers were expected to reveal)
  something of moment about Junius; So that we may at length look for the
  solution of this important query.</p>

  <p>Messrs. Puttick and Simpson (191. Piccadilly) will sell, on Monday and
  Tuesday next, a collection of Choice Books, mostly in beautiful
  condition. Among the more curious lots are, an unpublished work of
  Archbishop Laud, on <i>Church Government</i>, said to have been presented
  to Charles I. for the instruction of Prince Henry; and an unique Series
  of Illustrations for Scotland, consisting of several thousand engravings,
  and many interesting drawings and autographs.</p>

  <p>We have received the following Catalogues:&mdash;Bernard Quaritch's
  (16. Castle Street, Leicester Square) Catalogue (No. 24.) of Books in
  European and Oriental Languages and Dialects, Fine Arts, Antiquities,
  &amp;c.; Waller and Son's (188. Fleet Street) Catalogue of Autograph
  Letters and Manuscripts, English and Foreign, containing many rare and
  interesting Documents.</p>
